			<p> This is the project for the 2019 Niagara College Design-a-thon. Working as a group, we had to redesign the freeze-dried food brand, 70below. The target audience of this brand is outdoors people who are looking for food to take on their camping or hiking trips. The client wanted a simple logo that reflected the outdoors element of the brand. Firstly, as a group, we worked on the brand identity, which I then took and applied to a range of business stationary, including letterhead, envelopes, and business cards. The largest challenge with this project was that we had a short timeline of only 10 hours to complete the project. The final product was a clean brand identity that was used on packaging and stationary.
