			<p> This piece was created using only colour and typography to illustrate the lyrics to Bruce Springsteen’s song, “War”. The main audience is Bruce Springsteen’s fans and people who enjoy the song. The concept was to make something simple with high contrast colours to bring emphasis to the lyrics and themes of the song. The first step was to choose which lyrics would be the best to include, and from that selection which lyrics and words would need the contrasting colours. Then came the layout of the final piece. The hardest part was trying to take a deep and meaningful song and make it easy to understand. The final piece was a double gatefold brochure with illustrated typography using the lyrics to “War” by Bruce Springsteen.
