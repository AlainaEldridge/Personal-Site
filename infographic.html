			<p> The objective of this project was to illustrate the instructions of baking chocolate chip cookies using humour. A basic colour palette was used so that viewers can focus on the instructions and learn that it is sometimes better to just go buy cookies. The first step of making this was to figure out the steps involved and how to best illustrate them. Then the layout of the piece was done to help the viewer figure out what order the steps went in. The biggest challenge was to show the steps and have them make sense with using limited type. The final was an illustrated guide on how to bake chocolate chip cookies and why itâ€™s easier to just buy them.
