			<p>This project was to create a visual identity for “Girls Garage” a fictious automotive repair shop. This included stationary, buttons, and a brand book. The target audience was female car owners, as they often will be spoken down to or overcharged at automotive garages, so they can come to this store to ensure they are getting fair service. This brand needed to be feminine but tough. Metallic elements to show the premium quality of the work. The process of this project started with figuring out the best words to describe the feel of the company. Next was choosing the colours that reflected the feminine aspects but weren’t too girly. The tire tread element in the logo was to further show that this is for the automotive industry. The two biggest challenges were to ensure the brand was a cohesive unit and could be viewed separately while being recognizable. The second challenge was to choose appropriate colours. This is a dynamic brand identity that shows the feminine side of the business while still being reputable.
