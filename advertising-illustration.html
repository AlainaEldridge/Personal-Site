			<p> The objective of this project was to create and illustration for one of Air Canada’s popular destinations, Scotland. The main audience for this piece is adults looking to go on a vacation. For this piece I wanted to embrace the rich folklore from Scotland, which was illustrated on a historical looking map creating a treasure map out of the stories and different places there. This fed into the tagline of the advertisement, “Find your story in Scotland”. Some challenges with this piece was ensuring the stories came from Scotland, as many of the stories will have transferred from other surrounding countries. The second challenge was getting easy to recognize imagery for each story, as the stories are widely known but not many people would know what the subjects of the stories would look like. The outcome of this work is an old treasure map of Scotland showing the many popular stories from the area. This advertisement shows how you can “find your story in Scotland”.
