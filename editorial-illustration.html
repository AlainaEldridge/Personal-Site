			<p>November 2019<br>The objective of this project was to illustrate a National Geographic article titled Why Cemeteries are a Surprising Source of Life. The target audience was National Geographic readers who are mainly older, well educated adults. To visually conceptualize this piece the client wanted to show the unity between cemeteries and the many plants and insects who call them home.
			The design process of this piece began with a visual exploration of unity and gain a deeper understanding of how cemeteries and the lifeforms within them are connected. A gender-neutral person is shown to further imply how this connection occurs all over the world. The colour choices were chosen to juxtapose each other while being the same value to include a sense of unity.
			Two of the biggest challenges were maintaining the balance of showing both subjects equally and to design around the article as a supporting element to what the author was saying. The outcome is a dynamic and juxtaposed illustration effectively visualizing the content of the article. </p>
