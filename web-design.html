			<p>December 2019 <br>The objective of this project was to create an accessible website for Casa El Norte which is a not-for-profit charity supporting immigrants as they come into Canada. The target audience includes immigrants looking for Canadian services and people who are looking to give back to the community by volunteering there. The concept idea for this project was a clean and simple website that will translate well across the world.
			The first step in the process was to research the target audience and determine their needs and abilities. This led into a focus on the user experience that the user will have with this website. The main challenge was trying to design for such a diverse group of people and making sure that it would fit all users needs. The outcome is a website that showcases the numerous services that Casa El Norte offers in a clean and simple layout</p>
