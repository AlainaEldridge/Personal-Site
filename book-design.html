			<p> April 2019 <br>The main objective of the client was to take a classic novel and redesign it to be appealing to a modern, youthful audience. Also, the client wished to encourage the reading of classic books. The main concept was to take a significant image from the story and visually display it for the cover of the book. 
			Dances and balls were the main form of socialising in the Regency Period and young people would learn the different dance moves from cards showing the steps in order, which became the inspiration for the cover illustration. The colour scheme was chosen to make the design stand out from other versions of the book, which often have pastel colour combinations. The process of bringing the concept to life began with research into the popular dances at the time of Jane Austen writing the novel, to illustrate the cover of the book. The research continued into colour schemes to find and maintain the balance between something eye catching while still upholding the rich, upper-class feeling. The inner page design was a more modern layout to level out the older language in which the novel was written. 
			The largest challenge was to keep the balance of the historic feel of the book and the modern look. The other challenge was ensuring the dance pattern was clear, as it is a historic artifact that not many people are familiar with today. The final product is a modern design adaptation of the classic novel, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, which utilizes historic imagery with modern touches.
